# CTMBIDS
This is a work in progress. Soon, after all the implementations, the work will be shared both here and on my scholar accounts.

A Tsetlin machine is a form of learning automaton based upon algorithms from reinforcement learning to learn expressions from propositional logic (Wikipedia).
This is the model that I employed to detect Intrusions in Software Defined Networks. More works to be employed in this repo.

# CTMBIDS
This work is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for DDoS attacks in SDN environments that utilizes Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM). Detection of DoS and DDoS attacks occurs using a model called CTMBIDS (Convolutional Tsetlin Machine Based Intrusion Detection System) by training a novel model using generated features. These feature can be used both fully and partially to train the CTMBIDS model. We call these them full-feature datasets and sub-feature dataset. For the sub-feature datasets, an algorithm called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) eliminates irrelevant features and keeps the most important ones for the classification task at hand.

# Papaer
The paper for this work is being reviewed by Applied Intelligence Journal. The work's latest status will be update on this repo.

# Data
The unmodified data that had been generated is in `Data (Unmodified)` folder and its python code is in `Data Generation Code`.
