# CTMBIDS
This work is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for DDoS attacks in SDN environments that utilizes Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (CTM). Detection of DoS and DDoS attacks occurs using a model called CTMBIDS (Convolutional Tsetlin Machine Based Intrusion Detection System) by training a novel model using generated features. These feature can be used both fully and partially to train the CTMBIDS model. We call these them full-feature datasets and sub-feature dataset. For the sub-feature datasets, an algorithm called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) eliminates irrelevant features and keeps the most important ones for the classification task at hand.
