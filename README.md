# CTMBIDS
This is a work in progress. Soon, after all the implementations, the work will be shared both here and on my scholar accounts.
A Tsetlin machine is a form of learning automaton based upon algorithms from reinforcement learning to learn expressions from propositional logic (Wikipedia).
This is the model that I employed to detect Intrusions in Software Defined Networks. More works to be employed in this repo.
